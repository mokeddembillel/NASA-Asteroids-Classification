    # Neo Reference ID - Near Earth Object (NEO) reference ID number for an asteroid (or a comet) which comes close to earth
    # Name - 'Name' of asteroid (same as NEO Reference ID)
    # Absolute Magnitude - A measure of the asteroid's luminosity (in H) (the brightness of an asteroid if it is 1 astronomical unit away from both the Sun and the observer, and the angle between the Sun, asteroid, and Earth is 0 degrees)
    # Est Dia in (in KM, M, Miles, and Feet) (min) - Minimum estimated diameter of the asteroid (Note: Since asteroids cannot be directly measured and because they have irregular shapes, their diameters are estimates. These estimates are calculated using its absolute magnitude and geometric albedo.)

# we'll keep km per second only
X.drop(['Relative Velocity km per hr', 'Miles per hour'], axis=1, inplace=True)

X.drop(['Miss Dist.(Astronomical)', 'Miss Dist.(lunar)',

# - we'll also drop Orbit Determination Date as there is no logical reason why
#   it should affect the target
X.drop('Orbit Determination Date', axis=1, inplace=True)

# - since Jupiter Tisserand Invariant is exactly calculate from semi-major axis, 
#   eccentricity and inclination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisserand%27s_parameter)
#   so there is no need to keep it because those three variables explain it perfectly 
X.drop('Jupiter Tisserand Invariant', axis=1, inplace=True)

#   velocity vectors is specified so we will drop it since it's not relevent 
#   to the target
X.drop('Epoch Osculation', axis=1, inplace=True)

# - Close Approach Date and Epoch Date Close Approach are the same measures in two 
#   different units, so keeping one of them is fine but i did a little bit of 
#   searching and i foundout that these two features do not impact the target 
#   so we will remove them 
X.drop(['Close Approach Date', 'Epoch Date Close Approach'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# Now we've finished removing features based on logical reasons which are infered

correlation = X.corr()

# - after plotting the heatmap i noticed that the Estimated Diameter min and max has 
#   a correlation of 1 that means they are stricly correlated, at first i thought 
#   they were measured in some way but after i googled it, i foundout that they are 
#   calculated based on the absolute magnitude and an assumed geometric albedo (ratio 
#   of the light received by a body to the light reflected by that body). since we don't
#   albedo in our dataset we need to keep only one of them or better approach 
#   is to calculate the average because keeping the only the min or max will make 
#   us underestimating or overestimating the asteroid 
X['Est Dia in M(average)'] = X[['Est Dia in M(min)', 'Est Dia in M(max)']].mean(axis=1)
X.drop(['Est Dia in M(min)', 'Est Dia in M(max)'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# - Aphelion Distance has about 0.98 correlation with Semi Major Axis and Orbital 
#   Period and 0.7 with Eccentricity and after a quick search i foundout that Aphelion 
#   Distance is calculated based on Semi Major Axis and Eccentricity see this article (https://socratic.org/questions/how-do-you-calculate-the-aphelion-and-perihelion-of-a-comet-s-orbit-if-it-has-an#:~:text=The%20perihelion%20distance%20P%3Da,e%3D0.875%20is%20the%20eccentricity.)
#   and for Orbital Period it's calculated using Keplerâ€™s Third Law based on 
#   the constant pi, the semi-major axis, the gravitational constant, the mass of 
#   the Sun, and the mass of the comet. (we can ignore the mass of the comet because 
#   it's small comparing to the mass of the sun) (take a look at this link: https://public.nrao.edu/ask/how-to-calculate-the-orbital-period-of-a-comet-given-its-closest-and-furthest-orbital-distance/), 
#   so basically they are all constants besides the semi-major axis ,
#   so we'll remove these two columns for now 
X.drop(['Aphelion Dist', 'Orbital Period'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# - We have also Orbit ID has a strong correlation with the Estimated Diameter,
#   however i still think that Orbit ID should not be removed because multiple asteroids
#   with the same estimated diameter could have different orbits, but kepping it will 
#   make the dataset very large since we will have to do a one hot encoding to it since
#   it is a categorical variable so i think it's better to remove it considering the 
#   high correlation, Estimated Diameter will do a good job on its own, and for Orbit
#   Uncertainty, it has high correlation with absolute magnitude and it's calculated 
#   using eccentricity, orbital period, which we already have it's components, 
#   and some other parameters
X.drop(['Orbit Uncertainity', 'Orbit ID'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# - we also have mean motion has a strong negative correlation with Semi Major Axis, 
#   basically it's calculated by dividing 2*pi on Orbital Period (which is mainly 
#   calculated using Semi Major Axis) so that make sence (see this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_motion)
#   i think it's okay to drop this since it doesn't appear to hold any valiable information
X.drop('Mean Motion', axis=1, inplace=True)

# I'm i'm still not quite sure about my way of thinking since i read that high
# correlation doesn't imply redundancy so i tried to be sure that a variable that
# i deleted doesn't explain valiable information to the model, but anyway i will still try
# to fit the model with and without some variables
